to move player A:

get a random number between zero and nine

1 digit = 10%
2 digits = 20%
3 digits = 30%
etc.

set desigated numbers to represent the options of moving because they're random

go through each option and set that number to equal a number of moves for player A

add that to where player one was before their turn (originally starting at zero)

repeat this for player B with different probability

if players land on the same space, player A must move back one

print the "board" after each round

once a player hits the 50th space, they win!
